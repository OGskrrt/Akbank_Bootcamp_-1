# Akbank Machine Learning Bootcamp #1

This project was developed as part of the "Akbank Machine Learning Bootcamp: New Generation Project Camp" training program organized in collaboration with Akbank and Global AI HUB.

The dataset utilized in this project pertains to diabetes research conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, sourced from the National Institute of Kidney Diseases in the USA. The objective was to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether individuals have diabetes based on their characteristics.

The project serves as an educational resource for understanding the fundamentals of machine learning. It covers various aspects including types of variables, learning methods, and problem types. Furthermore, it delves into the concept of machine learning models, discussing their components, evaluation metrics, and validation techniques.

In addition to providing insights into the dataset, the project encompasses several stages:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This section explores the dataset, providing insights into its structure, distributions, and relationships between variables.


Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling outliers and scaling features to prepare it for model training.


Model Selection and Prediction: Multiple machine learning models including Decision Tree, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost are trained and evaluated using cross-validation.


Hyperparameter Optimization: The CatBoost model, identified as the best performer, undergoes hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV to improve its performance.


Model Evaluation: The optimized CatBoost model is evaluated based on accuracy score, providing an indication of its predictive performance.


This comprehensive approach aims to provide participants with a thorough understanding of the machine learning workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation. By leveraging the provided Python code, participants can easily follow along and customize the project according to their needs.
